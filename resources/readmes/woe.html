  Each gamer has its own account, registered in the database.
  Registration data is verified by the appropriate subsystem.
  On the created account with a unique login, a hero is created in one of the selected classes.
  Archer, Mage and Warrior are currently implemented.
  Heroes initially receives basic equipment, which is enough for a few basic
  expeditions in which the player is doing relatively well to the class.
  The player sends his heroes on a journey.
  To be able to take part in an expedition,
  he must not take part in another one and must have sufficiently good equipment.
  The more difficult the mission, the better equipment the player must have.
  After completing the mission, the player receives the appropriate amount of raw materials, e.g. gold, which can be exchanged for other equipment in the store.
  The game has a ranking of heroes based on their attack and defensively.
  Character ranking is general or class and item ranking is separate.</p>

<h2 id="general-info">General Info</h2>
<p>The GUI of the application was written in Java (Swing).
  The database part consists of the MySQL relational database.
  Communication between the above technologies is ensured by the
  JDBC software interface, the &#39;Connection Pooling&#39; technique, which
  reduces the number of costly connections with the database to a minimum.
  Designed in a way that is open to further development of the application,
  adding new classes, items or the expeditions themselves.
